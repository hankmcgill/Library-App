# Library App

## Introduction
I made this CRUD app as part of The Odin Project's JavaScript course.  I tried to design the app in a way that implements array methods and also shows my own unique sense of style.  If using a sleek comic-book inspired aesthetic is a crime - lock me up and throw away the key!

## Features
I wrote this app using vanilla JavaScript.
